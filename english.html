		<li> <h3>Revise Evidence</h3>
        <ul>
			In relation to analytical text response essays, revising evidence doesn't necessarily mean memorising quotes. In fact, most of the time if you use a variety of evidence it will benefit both your essay and your grade. However, this doesn't mean to completely disregard quotes as evidence, they are a great way to back up your arguments but sometimes it is better to include a variety of sources. Other evidence you can use includes:
			<p> </p>
            <li>Author's intention</li>
            <li>Characters</li>
            <li>Plots/Events</li>
            <li>Language/tone</li>
			<li>Symbolism</li>
			<li>Imagery</li>
			<li>Narrative voice/monologue</li>
			<li>ETCETERA</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
				
		<li> <h3>Note Themes </h3>
	    Noting themes helps to familiarise yourself with the content you are studying as well as the most likely prompts you will be given in your SACS and exams. For example, you could be reading a book with the theme of fulfilment therefore the prompt could be along the lines of: “People should stop chasing fulfilment and start being grateful” Discuss this idea in response to [Book Title].</li>
				
		<li> <h3>Read</h3>
		  This shouldn’t be much of a surprise that there will be a lot of reading involved with this subject. Many great ways to study English include reading because it helps with memory, comprehension, and execution. There are many ways to do this including:
		  <p> </p>
			<ul>
            <li>Read the text you are studying</li>
            <li>Essays/SACS you have written</li>
            <li>Evidence/themes</li>
            <li>Other students' essays</li>
			<li>Your teacher's feedback</li>
			<li>English VCE study design</li>
		  </ul>
	  </li>
				
		<li> <h3>Avoid writing essays</h3> 
	    Most students believe that writing a lot of essays will improve their writing and comprehension of this subject. However, in most cases, students end up being burned out, stressed, and at a loss for further ideas. When you are constantly writing practice essays you begin to create very similar work, confine your ideas, and not see any need for improvement. Instead, write fewer practice essays and try not to finish most of them in order to focus on the quality of your work rather than the quantity. Then you can annotate those essays with your feedback, and receive feedback from your teacher, a peer, and someone else. Now that you know the ways you can improve your writing focus your energy towards improving those skills rather than writing a bunch of useless essays. Although I am not saying that this is bad for everyone because everyone is different and we all learn differently, I’ve just seen that this works for the majority of students.</li>
				
		<li> <h3>The Craft of the Writing Process</h3>
		  In order to receive a high grade in this area of study, no matter what form you are doing you are marked on the same things which are:
		  <p> </p>
			<ul>
            <li>Exploration and development of the theme you are studying eg. Fulfilment.</li>
            <li>Shaping of text structures, language features and vocabulary for effective writing.</li>
            <li>Coherent and fluent structure.</li>
            <li>Controlled and accurate use of Australian Standard English conventions.</li>
				If all these requirements are demonstrated in your creative, persuasive, informative or reflective piece then you will achieve your goal of increasing your grades.
		</ul>
	  </li>
				
		<li> <h3>Study design</h3> 
		  One of the most important things you can do in any subject you are studying is to look through the study design. They are literally giving you the main knowledge you will need to succeed in the subject as well as how you will be assessed.
