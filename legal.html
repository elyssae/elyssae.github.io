		<li> <h3>Follow the news</h3>
	  Following the news is such an easy yet effective way to build on your knowledge. This is because by constantly reading legal cases rather than knowing the information you understand it too as well as it is great to have as examples in your SACS/exams.</li>
				
		<li> <h3>Practice questions</h3>
	  Practice questions are useful for every subject because they help students to familiarise themselves with the environment they will be working in. By doing practice questions they will decrease their stress, increase confidence, increase knowledge, etc.</li>
				
		<li> <h3>Case studies</h3>
	  Case studies help you to identify the main knowledge you are required to apply during SACS and exams. They are also very useful to remember because quite frequently there are questions asking you to refer to a case study that is either provided. Not to mention that the majority of legal studies questions require you to provide an example and case studies are excellent ways to demonstrate your knowledge on a topic.</li>
				
		<li> <h3>Definitions</h3>
	  You need to know your definitions in most subjects other than English because in most year 12 end-of-year exams you will have a section dedicated to definitions. Not only that but by knowing your definitions you will increase your understanding of the content you are studying.</li>
				
		<li> <h3>Task words</h3>
		  Task words are also important for most subjects other than English however they all are different and mean different things in different classes. In Legal Studies, they are:
		  <p> </p>
			<ul>
            <li>Analyse: examine the main features and how they relate.</li>
            <li>Explain: define, identify the features, and provide an example.</li>
            <li>Apply: relate theory to an example and create connections.</li>
            <li>Compare: similarities and differences.</li>
			<li>Define: state the meaning of a phrase or word.</li>
			<li>Describe: a detailed account of the facts in sequential order.</li>
			<li>Discuss: in response to provided information examine both sides of the issue.</li>
			<li>Distinguish: show the points of difference.</li>
			<li>Evaluate: examine the strengths and weaknesses and provide your opinion.</li>
			<li>Identify: establish information, key characteristics, or features.</li>
			<li>Interpret: use your knowledge to clearly explain something.</li>
			<li>Illustrate: provide an example that supports a statement.</li>
			<li>Outline/list: a brief description.</li>
			<li>Justify: provide valid reasons or evidence to support a statement.</li>
        </ul>
	  </li>
			
		<li> <h3>Study Design</h3>
	    One of the most important things you can do in any subject you are studying is to look through the study design. They are literally giving you the main knowledge you will need to succeed in the subject as well as how you will be assessed. <p><a href= "https://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/curriculum/vce/vce-study-designs/legalstudies/Pages/Index.aspx" target="_blank" class="smallink">You can find the VCE Legal Studies study design here</a></p></li>
